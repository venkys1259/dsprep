https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

 Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
Example 3:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
 ,

Constraints:

1 <= piles.length <= 104
piles.length <= h <= 109
1 <= piles[i] <= 109

    Approach:
    1. Assume koko can eat atleast 1 banana per hour and atMax  as maximum number of bananas in all the piles
    so, left = 1, right = maximum of given array, mid = (l+r)/2
    2. we do binary search here with  mid point as minimum number of bananas that koko can eat in an hour
       and calculate the speed for the mid point.
    3.if koko takes less than or equal time than h means
       we need to try in the lower bound for optimization --> right = mid-1
       if koko takes more time, then we will try with upper bound --> mid+1.
