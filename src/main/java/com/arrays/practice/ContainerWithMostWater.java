https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Notice that you may not slant the container.
Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
Example 4:

Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2


Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

    Optimized Solution In Single Pass:
    1. take 2 pointers as i = 0, j= length -1;
       calculate the area --> shorter line height * difference between ith and jth vertical line
       if height of ith index is less than j then move right
       else decrement j ( move left)
       reason: we want max area, so if height of ith index is less than jth line,
        then there is no point in calculating area with smaller number.
